# CLDF: Cross-linguistic Data Formats

CLDF is a specification of data formats suitable to encode 
[cross-linguistic data](https://cldf.clld.org/)
in a way that maximizes interoperability and reusability, thus contributing to
FAIR Cross-Linguistic Data.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", 
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be 
interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

## Conformance Levels

CLDF is based on W3C's suite of specifications for [CSV on the Web](https://www.w3.org/TR/tabular-data-primer/), 
or short CSVW.
A CLDF dataset is:

- a set of UTF-8 encoded CSV files 
- described by a [CSVW TableGroup](http://w3c.github.io/csvw/metadata/#table-groups) serialized as JSON file
- with a [common property](http://w3c.github.io/csvw/metadata/#dfn-common-property) `dc:conformsTo` having one of the
  [CLDF module](#cldf-modules) URIs as value.

While the [JSON-LD dialect](https://www.w3.org/TR/tabular-metadata/#json-ld-dialect) to be used for metadata according 
to the [Metadata Vocabulary for Tabular Data](https://www.w3.org/TR/tabular-metadata/) can be edited by hand, this may 
already be beyond what can be expected by regular users. Thus, CLDF specifies two conformance levels for datasets: 
metadata-free or extended.


### Metadata-free conformance

A dataset can be CLDF conformant without providing a separate metadata description file. To do so, the dataset MUST 
follow the default specification for the appropriate module regarding:

- file names
- column names (for specified columns)
- CSV dialect

Thus, rather than not *having* any metadata, the dataset does not *specify*
any; instead it falls back to using the defaults, i.e. "free" as in "beer" not
as in "gluten-free". The CSV file MAY contain additional columns not specified in 
the default module descriptions.

The default file names and column names are described in [`components`](components). The default CSV dialect is 
[RFC4180](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180) using the [UTF-8](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) character encoding, 
i.e. the CSV dialect specified as:

```
{
  "encoding": "utf-8",
  "lineTerminators": ["\r\n", "\n"],
  "quoteChar": "\"",
  "doubleQuote": true,
  "skipRows": 0,
  "commentPrefix": "#",
  "header": true,
  "headerRowCount": 1,
  "delimiter": ",",
  "skipColumns": 0,
  "skipBlankRows": false,
  "skipInitialSpace": false,
  "trim": false
}
```

Some of the effects of this metadata-free conformance are:
- The first line of each file must contain the comma-separated list of column names.
- No comment lines are allowed.


### Extended conformance

A dataset is CLDF conformant if it uses a custom metadata file, derived from the default profile for the appropriate 
module. The metadata MUST specify a `dc:conformsTo` property with one of the CLDF module URIs as value.

Providing a metadata file allows for considerable flexibility in describing the data files, because the following
aspects can be customized (within the boundaries of the CSVW specification):
- the CSV [dialect description](http://w3c.github.io/csvw/metadata/#dialect-descriptions) (possibly per table), e.g. to:
  - allow comment lines (if appropriately prefixed with [`commentPrefix`](http://w3c.github.io/csvw/metadata/#dialect-commentPrefix))
  - omit a header line (if appropriately indicated by `"header": false`)
  - use tab-separated data files (if appropriately indicated by `"delimiter": "\t"`)
- the table property [url](http://w3c.github.io/csvw/metadata/#tables)
- the column property [titles](http://w3c.github.io/csvw/metadata/#columns)
- the inherited column properties
  - [default](http://w3c.github.io/csvw/metadata/#cell-default)
  - [null](http://w3c.github.io/csvw/metadata/#cell-null)
  - [separator](http://w3c.github.io/csvw/metadata/#cell-separator)
- adding common properties,
- adding [foreign keys](#foreign-keys), to specify relations between tables of the dataset.

Thus, using extended conformance via metadata, a dataset may:

- use tab-separated data files,
- use non-default file names,
- use non-default column names,
- add metadata describing attribution and provenance of the data,
- specify [relations between multiple tables](http://w3c.github.io/csvw/metadata/#foreign-key-reference-between-tables) in a dataset,
- supply default values for required columns like `Language_ID`, using [virtual columns](http://w3c.github.io/csvw/metadata/#use-of-virtual-columns).

In particular, since the metadata description resides in a separate file, it is often possible to retrofit existing CSV files into the CLDF framework by adding a metadata description.

Thus, conformant CLDF processing software MUST implement support for the CSVW specification to the [extent necessary](#metadata).


## CLDF Ontology

CLDF data uses terms from the [CLDF Ontology](http://cldf.clld.org/v1.0/terms.rdf), as specified in the file `terms.rdf`, 
to mark [`TableGroup`](http://w3c.github.io/csvw/metadata/#table-groups) or [`Table`](http://w3c.github.io/csvw/metadata/#tables) 
objects which have special meaning (specifying modules or components respectively) within the CLDF framework.

The CLDF Ontology also provides a set of [properties](http://cldf.clld.org/v1.0/terms.rdf#properties) to attach 
semantics to individual columns. While many of these properties are similar (or identical) to properties defined 
elsewhere - most notably in the [General Ontology for Linguistic Description - GOLD](http://linguistics-ontology.org/) - 
we opted for inclusion to avoid ambiguity, but made sure to reference the related properties in the ontology.

Note that the column *names* in the default table descriptions (e.g. [`formTable`](components/forms)) are not always 
the same as the column *properties*. Each column has both a `csvw:name` and a separate `propertyURL` linking the column 
to the CLDF Ontology. Each property also has a `rdf:label` which might also be different.

**Notes:**
- In an ill-advised attempt to version the ontology, `v1.0` has been baked into the term
  URIs. While this may be a good idea in case of incompatible changes (e.g. if the semantics
  of a term changed), it presents an obstacle for initeroperability in case of backwards-compatible
  changes. So starting with CLDF 1.1, we will keep `http://cldf.clld.org/v1.0/terms.rdf`
  as namespace for **all** versions of the 1.x series, and specify the particular version
  when a term was introduced using `dc:hasVersion` properties per term.
- For better human readability the [CLDF Ontology](http://cldf.clld.org/v1.0/terms.rdf) should
be visited with a browser capable of rendering XSLT - such as Firefox.


## CLDF Dataset

<a name="metadata"></a>
### CLDF Metadata file

A CLDF dataset is described with metadata provided as JSON file following the 
[Metadata Vocabulary for Tabular Data](https://www.w3.org/TR/tabular-metadata/). 
To make tooling simpler, we restrict the metadata specification as follows:

- Metadata files MUST specify a `tables` property on top-level, i.e. MUST describe a 
  [`TableGroup`](http://w3c.github.io/csvw/metadata/#table-groups). While this adds a 
  bit of verbosity to the metadata description, it makes it possible to describe multiple 
  tables in one metadata file.
- The common property `dc:conformsTo` of the `TableGroup` is used to indicate the
  CLDF module, e.g. 
  `"dc:conformsTo": "http://cldf.clld.org/v1.0/terms.rdf#Wordlist"`
- The common property `dc:conformsTo` of a `Table` is used to associate tables with
  a particular role in a CLDF module using appropriate classes from the 
  [CLDF Ontology](http://cldf.clld.org/v1.0/terms.rdf).
- If each row in the data file corresponds to a resource on the web (i.e. a resource
  identified by a dereferenceable HTTP URI), the `tableSchema` property SHOULD provide an 
  `aboutUrl` property.
- If individual cells in a row correspond to resources on the web, the corresponding 
  column specification SHOULD provide a `valueUrl` property.

Each dataset SHOULD provide a dataset distribution description using the 
[DCAT vocabulary](http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/#class-distribution). This will make it easy to  
[catalog](http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/#class-catalog) cross-linguistic datasets. 
In particular, each dataset description SHOULD include these properties:

- [dc:bibliographicCitation](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/#http://purl.org/dc/terms/bibliographicCitation) and
- [dc:license](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/#http://purl.org/dc/terms/license).

Thus, an example for a CLDF dataset description could look as follows:

```

            "datatype": "string",
            "propertyUrl": "http://cldf.clld.org/v1.0/terms.rdf#comment"
          },
          {
            "name": "Source",
            "datatype": "string",
            "propertyUrl": "http://cldf.clld.org/v1.0/terms.rdf#source"
          },
          {
            "name": "Glottocode",
            "virtual": true,
            "propertyUrl": "http://cldf.clld.org/v1.0/terms.rdf#glottocode",
            "valueUrl": "{Language_ID}"
          },
        ],
        "aboutUrl": "http://example.org/valuesets/{ID}",
        "primaryKey": "ID"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```


### CLDF Data files

While it is possible to add any kind of CSV files to a CLDF dataset (by virtue of being an extension of CSVW), 
the CLDF standard recognizes (and attaches specified semantics) to tables described with a common property 
`dc:conformsTo` with one of the [component](#cldf-components) URIs of the [CLDF Ontology](http://cldf.clld.org/v1.0/terms.rdf) as value.

Additionally, CLDF semantics can be assigned to individual columns by 
assigning one of the property URIs defined in the 
[CLDF Ontology](http://cldf.clld.org/v1.0/terms.rdf) as `propertyUrl`.
CLDF conformant software MUST detect CLDF-specific columns by matching the `propertyUrl` to CLDF Ontology terms
and NOT by matching column name to default column names recommended in the ontology.


#### Column specifications

- CLDF column properties are assumed to have a complete row (or rather the
  entity a row stores data about) as scope; e.g. a [source column](#sources)
  is assumed to provide source information for any piece of data in the row.
  Thus, **each property can be used only once per table**, which makes processing simpler.
- More generally, CLDF assumes **column names in a table to be unique**.
- Since CLDF is designed to enable data reuse, data creators should assume that schema information
  like table or column names ends up in all sorts of environments, e.g. as names in SQL databases or
  as parts of URLs of a web application. Thus, it is RECOMMENDED to stick to ASCII characters in such
  names and avoid usage of punctuation other than `:._-`.
- **Cardinality:** CSVW allows specifying columns as "multivalued", i.e. as containing a list of values (of the same datatype),
  using the `separator` property. Thus, CLDF consumers MUST consult a column's `separator` property,
  to figure out whether the value must be interpreted as list or not. Note that this also applies to foreign keys.
  However, CLDF may restrict the cardinality as follows:
  - The specification of a property in the ontology MAY contain a `dc:extent` property
    with value `singlevalued` or `multivalued`, fixing cardinality of any instance of
    such a column in any table.
  - The specification of a column in the default metadata of a *component* MAY contain
    a `dc:extent` property with value `singlevalued` or `multivalued`, fixing cardinality.


#### Identifier

Each CLDF data table SHOULD contain a column which uniquely identifies a row in 
the table. This column SHOULD be marked using:

- a `propertyUrl` of `http://cldf.cld.org/v1.0/terms.rdf#id`
- the column name `ID` in the case of metadata-free conformance.

To allow usage of identifiers as path components of URIs and ensure they are
portable across systems, identifiers SHOULD be composed of 
[alphanumeric characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphanumeric), 
underscore `_` and hyphen `-` only, i.e. match the regular expression 
`[a-zA-Z0-9\-_]+` (see [RFC 3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-2.3)).

Following our design goal to reference rather than duplicate data, identifiers
may be used to reference existing entities (e.g. [Glottolog languages](http://glottolog.org/glottolog/language), [WALS features](http://wals.info/feature),
etc.). This can be done as follows:

- If the identifier can be interpreted as links to other entities, e.g. 
  using the WALS three-lettered language codes to identify languages, this should be 
  indicated by assigning the column an appropriate `valueUrl` property, e.g. 
  `http://wals.info/languoid/lect/wals_code_{ID}`
- If the identifier follows a specified identification scheme, e.g. [ISO 639-3](http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/) for
  languages, this can be indicated by adding [a virtual column](http://w3c.github.io/csvw/metadata/#x5-6-1-1-use-of-virtual-columns) with a suitable `propertyUrl`
  to the table's list of columns.


#### Missing data

Data creators often want to distinguish two kinds of missing data, in particular when the data is extracted from
sources:
1. data that is missing/unknown because it was never extracted from the source,
2. data that is indicated in the source as unknown.

The CSVW data model can be used to express this difference as follows:

- Case 1 can be modeled by not including the relevant data as row at all.
- Case 2 can be modeled using the `null` property of the relevant column specification (defaulting to the empty
string) as value in a data row.


#### Sources

Considering that any single step in collecting (cross-)linguistic data involves some
amount of analysis and judgement calls, it is essential to make it easy to trace
assertions back to their source.

Each CLDF data table may contain a column listing sources for the data asserted in the
row. This column MUST be marked using:

- a `propertyUrl` of `http://cldf.cld.org/v1.0/terms.rdf#source`
- the column name `Source` in the case of metadata-free conformance.

Sources are specified as semicolon-separated (unless the metadata specifies a different `separator`) source specifications, of the form
*source_ID[source context]*, e.g. *meier2015[3-12]* where *meier2015* is a citation key in the accompanying [sources file](#sources).


#### Foreign keys

Often cross-linguistic data is [relational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_model), e.g. *cognate judgements* 
group *forms* into *cognate sets*, creating a [many-to-many relationship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-to-many_(data_model)) 
between a `FormTable` and a `CognatesetTable`. 

To make such relations explicit, the CLDF Ontology provides a set of
[reference properties](http://cldf.clld.org/v1.0/terms.rdf#reference-properties).

Reference properties MUST be interpreted as foreign keys, e.g. a 
`propertyUrl` `http://cldf.clld.org/v1.0/terms.rdf#languageReference`
specified for column `Col1` of a table with `url` `table1.csv` is equivalent to a 
[CSVW foreign key constraint](http://w3c.github.io/csvw/metadata/#schema-foreignKeys)
```
  "foreignKeys": [
       {
           "columnReference": "Col1",
           "reference": {
               "resource": "languages.csv",
               "columnReference": "ID"
           }
       }
   ]
```
assuming that the `LanguageTable` component has `url` `languages.csv` and a column `ID` with `propertyUrl` `http://cldf.clld.org/v1.0/terms.rdf#id`.

While spelling out foreign key constraints may feel cumbersome, it is still RECOMMENDED that metadata creators
do so, to make the data compatible with CSVW tools. The foreign key constraints MUST be specified explicitly 
if the referenced column does not have a `propertyUrl` `http://cldf.clld.org/v1.0/terms.rdf#id`.

Note that columns for reference properties may still be "nullable", i.e. contain `NULL` values, to allow
for rows where no reference can be specified.


<a id="sources"> </a>

### Sources reference file

References to sources - if not referenced by Glottolog ID - can be supplied as part of a CLDF dataset as an UTF-8 
encoded BibTeX file (with the citation keys serving as local Source IDs). The filename of this BibTeX file MUST be either:

- `sources.bib` in case of metadata-free conformance
- or specified as top-level common property `dc:source` in the dataset's metadata.


## CLDF Modules

Much like 
[Dublin Core Application Profiles](http://dublincore.org/documents/profile-guidelines/),
CLDF Modules group terms of the CLDF Ontology into tables.
Thus, CLDF module specifications are recommendations for groups
of tables modeling typical cross-linguistic datatypes. Currently, the CLDF
specification recognizes the following modules:

- [Wordlist](modules/Wordlist)
- [Structure dataset](modules/StructureDataset)
- [Dictionary](modules/Dictionary)
- [Parallel text](modules/ParallelText)

In addition, a CLDF dataset can be specified as 
[*Generic*](http://cldf.clld.org/v1.0/terms.rdf#Generic), imposing no requirements
on tables or columns. Thus, *Generic* datasets are a way to evolve new data types 
(to become recognized modules), while already providing (generic) tool support.

In the CLDF Ontology [modules](http://cldf.clld.org/v1.0/terms.rdf#modules) are modeled 
as subclasses of [`dcat:Distribution`](http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#Distribution), thus 
additional metadata as recommended in the 
[DCAT specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/#class-distribution) should be 
provided.

For each type of CLDF dataset there is a *CLDF module*, i.e. a default metadata profile 
describing the required tables, columns and datatypes.
*metadata-free conformance* means data files will be read as if they were accompanied by 
the corresponding default metadata.


## CLDF Components

Some types of cross-linguistic data may be part of different CLDF modules. These
types are specified as *components* in a way that can be re-used across modules 
(typically as [table descriptions](http://w3c.github.io/csvw/metadata/#tables), which can be appended 
to the `tables` property of a module's metadata). A *component* is a CSVW table description with a
`dc:conformsTo` property having one of the component terms in the CLDF Ontology as value.
Each component listed below is described in a README and specified by the default
metadata file in the respective directory.

- [Language metadata](components/languages)
- [Parameter metadata](components/parameters)
- [Values](components/values) - as defined for a [`StructureDataset`](modules/StructureDataset)
- [Codes](components/codes)
- [Entries](components/entries)
- [Senses](components/senses)
- [Examples](components/examples)
- [Forms](components/forms) - as defined for a [`Wordlist`](modules/Wordlist)
- [Cognates](components/cognates)
- [CognateSets](components/cognatesets)
- [Borrowings](components/borrowings)
- [Functional Equivalents](components/functionalequivalents)
- [Functional Equivalents Sets](components/functionalequivalentsets)

A component corresponds to a certain type of data. Thus, to make sure all instances of
such a type have the same set of properties, we allow at most one component for each type
in a CLDF dataset.


## Compatibility

- Using UTF-8 as character encoding means editing these files with MS Excel is not completely trivial, because Excel 
  assumes cp1252 as default character encoding - Libre Office Calc on the other hand handles these files just fine.
- The tool support for CSV files is getting better and better due to increasing interest in [data science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science). Some particularly useful tools are:
  - [csvkit](https://csvkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
  - [q - Text as Data](http://harelba.github.io/q/)


## Versioning

Changes to the CLDF specification will be released as new versions, using
a [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) number scheme. While older versions
can be accessed via [releases of this repository](https://github.com/cldf/cldf/releases) or from 
[ZENODO](https://zenodo.org), where releases will be archived, the latest
released version is also reflected in the `master` branch of this repository,
i.e. whatever you see navigating the directory tree at [https://github.com/cldf/cldf](https://github.com/cldf/cldf/tree/master)
reflects the latest released version of the specification.


## History

Work on this proposal for a cross-linguistic data format was triggered by the [LANCLID 2 workshop](http://www.eva.mpg.de/linguistics/conferences/2014-ws-lanclid2/index.html) held in April 2015 in Leipzig -
in particular by Harald Hammarström's presentation [A Proposal for Data Interface Formats for Cross-Linguistic Data](https://github.com/clld/lanclid2/blob/master/presentations/hammarstrom.pdf).
