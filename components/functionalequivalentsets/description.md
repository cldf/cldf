# Functional Equivalents Sets

When aligning texts or sentences in an [`FunctionalEquivalentTable`](../functionalequivalents), sets of equivalents are constructed. 
Such sets are collected in a `FunctionalEquivalentsSetsTable` which can include further documentation and explanation about these sets.
