# Senses

When dictionaries or lexicons are encoded using CLDF's [`Dictionary`](../../modules/Dictionary) module,
each entry may be related to multiple senses (lemon's [LexicalSense](http://lemon-model.net/lemon#LexicalSense)) stored as rows in the `SenseTable`.


## Example

The `SenseTable` of the [DiidxazÃ¡ Lexico-Botanical Dictionary](https://dictionaria.clld.org/contributions/diidxaza)
is described here: https://github.com/dictionaria/diidxaza/blob/v1.2/cldf/cldf-metadata.json#L110-L187

> [!NOTE]
> Since the senses in this dictionary often reflect botanical species, a [`gbifReference`](https://cldf.clld.org/v1.0/terms.html#gbifReference)
> property could be added. Thus, the sense [Arnica](https://dictionaria.clld.org/units/diidxaza-E0110) could be
> assigned a `gbifReference` value of `5396557`, linking it to https://www.gbif.org/species/5396557
